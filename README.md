## Sovereign AI: Own Your Digital Presence

### The Problem with Platform Lock-In

Companies want to lock you into their solutions. You must use their tools. You can't export your data. You can't move to another platform. You must pay forever.

**"Recurring revenue"** is the business model for WordPress.com, Wix, Squarespace, Salesforce, and countless others.

### Why This Matters

- New platforms appear with better features
- New solutions appear at lower prices
- AI is changing everything — fast

**But you're locked into old solutions.** Your content is trapped. Your data is hostage. Migration is painful or impossible.

### The Sovereign Approach

| Platform Lock-In | Sovereign Development |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Files stored in their cloud | **Files on YOUR computer** |
| Proprietary formats | **Standard formats (React, HTML, CSS)** |
| Can't leave without losing work | **Take everything with you** |
| Pay forever or lose access | **You own it permanently** |

### The Solution

1. **Develop locally** — Your files, your machine, your control
2. **Use standard technologies** — Next.js, React, Docker (no proprietary lock-in)
3. **Deploy to AWS** — Portable containers, exportable anytime
4. **AI assists, you own** — The code is yours, not trapped in a builder

**Deploy to AWS is as easy as following this project.**

## Learn to Build and Deploy

This template teaches modern cloud development through hands-on practice. You'll deploy a professional landing page while learning containers, cloud services, and AI-assisted coding — skills that transfer to any project you want to build next.

**Course**: CSE651 - Software Development with Agentic AI ([CSTU.edu](https://cstu.edu))
**Demo**: AWS Builder Loft, San Francisco (March 2, 2026)

---

## What You'll Learn

| Phase | You'll Do | You'll Understand |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| **1. Local Dev** | Run containers locally | How Docker provides consistent environments |
| **2. Customize** | Edit with AI prompts | How to collaborate with AI coding assistants |
| **3. Preview** | Test production build | Why dev and prod builds differ |
| **4. Deploy** | Push to AWS | How cloud services host applications |

**Time to deployed site: ~1-2 hours**

### The Transformation

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "I need someone to build my site" | "I can build and deploy it myself" |
| "Cloud deployment sounds complex" | "I understand containers and cloud" |
| "AI coding tools are mysterious" | "I collaborate with AI to write code" |

---

## What You'll Build

A modern, responsive landing page that can serve as:
- **Consulting Services** page
- **Professional Portfolio**
- **Digital Resume/CV**
- **Freelance Business** site
- **Personal Brand** presence

### Success Story

> **Mark** started with this template, learned the fundamentals, and was inspired to build a **stock trading signal application** with backtesting. He deployed it to Vercel and is now exploring how to scale and market it.

## Prerequisites

| Required | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) | Container runtime for development and deployment |
| **Any CLI Coding Agent** (choose one): | AI-assisted development |
| - [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) | Anthropic's agentic coding assistant; available on AWS Bedrock|
| - [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) | OpenAI's agentic coding assistant |
| - [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) | Google's agentic coding assistant |

---

## Quick Start

After your start (either claude, codex or gemini):
```
"Clone the agentic-landing-template repository from https://github.com/pingwu/agentic-landing-template and start the development container"
```

Or manually from Shell (terminal):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/agentic-landing-template.git
cd agentic-landing-template
npm run docker:dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

That's it! The container includes Node.js, TypeScript, and all dependencies. Hot-reload is enabled - edit files and see changes instantly.

### Development Commands

| Natural Language (say this to your AI agent)      | CLI Command             |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| "Start the development container with hot-reload" | `npm run docker:dev`    |
| "Build and run the production container"          | `npm run docker:prod`   |
| "Stop all running containers"                     | `npm run docker:down`   |
| "Show me the container logs"                      | `npm run docker:logs`   |
| "What's the status of my containers?"             | `npm run docker:status` |
| "Open a shell in the dev container"               | `npm run docker:shell`  |
| "Clean up all containers and volumes"             | `npm run docker:clean`  |

### Customize Your Page

Open a new terminal with CLI coding agent open and tell it what you want:

```
"Update the hero section with my name 'John Smith' and tagline 'Full Stack Developer'"
```

```
"Change the primary color from blue to teal throughout the site"
```

```
"Add a testimonials section with 3 client quotes"
```

The AI assistant reads and edits files while the container serves your app. Changes appear immediately.

## Development → Production Pipeline

This template teaches the real-world workflow:

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│  Develop    │ ──▶ │ Containerize│ ──▶ │   Deploy    │
│ docker:dev  │     │ docker:prod │     │ AWS App     │
│             │     │             │     │ Runner      │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
```

**Why Docker from Day 1?**
- Same environment locally and in production
- No "works on my machine" issues
- Deployment-ready from the start
- Industry-standard workflow

### Agent Skills (Advanced Prompting)

The `.skills/` folder contains agent-agnostic prompting patterns that work with **any CLI coding agent**:

| Skill | What It Teaches |
|-------|-----------------|
| **aws-cli-architect** | Cloud infrastructure provisioning (cost-aware, security-first) |
| **pm-design-thinking** | Product thinking for web development |
| **multi-file-architecture** | Coordinated changes across entire codebases |
| **test-driven-scaffolding** | Write tests first, then implement |
| **context-aware-debugging** | Effective debugging with AI assistance |

**Usage example**:
```
"Using the test-driven-scaffolding approach from .skills/,
add form validation. Write tests first, show me, then implement."
```

See `AGENTS.md` for detailed skill documentation.

---

## Cost Estimate

| Service | Monthly Cost |
|---------|-------------|
| AWS App Runner (1 vCPU, 2GB) | $5-15 |
| ECR Storage | <$1 |
| Data Transfer | <$1 |
| **Total** | **~$7-17/month** |

*Costs vary based on traffic. First 12 months may qualify for AWS Free Tier.*

---

## System Prompts

This project includes optimized system prompts for AI assistants:

- **CLAUDE.md** - Configuration for Anthropic's Claude Code (AWS BedRock availalbe; similar token usage costs)
- **AGENTS.md** - Shared instructions for all AI coding agents
- **GEMINI.md** - Configuration for Google's Gemini CLI

These files help the AI understand your project structure and coding standards.

## Project History

This template evolved from [**MACA (Multi-AI-Coding-Agent)**](https://github.com/pingwu/maca), a comprehensive AI-assisted development curriculum created in 2025.

### The Evolution

```
MACA (Sept 2025)                    Agentic Landing Template (2026)
────────────────                    ────────────────────────────────
5 AI coding agents          →       3 focused agents (Claude, Gemini, Codex)
5 portfolio projects        →       1 hands-on project
Comprehensive curriculum    →       Accessible entry point
Multi-domain learning       →       Cloud deployment focus
```

### Core Philosophy (Unchanged)

> *"The new professional superpower is not coding; it's orchestrating AI agents to build for you."*
> — MACA Curriculum

This template carries forward MACA's core insight: **the skill that matters is expressing problems clearly so AI can help solve them**. Whether you're a developer seeking amplification or a domain expert without coding background, the approach is the same — learn to collaborate with AI.

### Why a Simpler Starting Point?

MACA taught us that learners need:
1. **Quick wins** — See results in hours, not weeks
2. **Real outcomes** — Build something they'll actually use
3. **Transferable skills** — Patterns that apply to any project

The landing page template delivers all three while opening the door to deeper learning.

### The Journey Continues

- **MACA** remains the comprehensive resource for those ready to go deeper
- **This template** is the accessible on-ramp
- **Future templates** (Chat, RAG, Multi-Agent) extend the learning path
