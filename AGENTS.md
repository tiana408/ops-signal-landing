# Agentic Landing Page Template

> **"When AI can do anything for you, what will you build?"**

This template teaches you to build and deploy cloud solutions with AI assistance — starting with your professional landing page.

**You'll learn**: Containers • Cloud Deployment • AI-Assisted Coding
**You'll build**: A live site that represents your professional brand
**You'll gain**: The confidence and skills to tackle your next, bigger idea

---

## Why This Exists

This isn't just a landing page template — it's your first step into building cloud-native, AI-assisted solutions.

### For Consultants & Professionals

Expand what you can offer clients by understanding the same tools your technical teams use. After this project, you'll speak the language of modern software development.

### For Students (CSE651)

Learn real-world deployment workflows used by companies worldwide. This is hands-on cloud computing, not just theory.

### For Builders & Founders

Validate ideas quickly. The same skills that deploy this landing page can deploy your MVP, prototype, or client demo.

### The Transformation

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "I need someone to build my site" | "I can build and deploy it myself" |
| "Cloud deployment sounds complex" | "I understand containers and cloud services" |
| "AI coding tools are mysterious" | "I collaborate with AI to write code" |
| "What if I want to build something else?" | "I have the skills to try" |

---

## What You'll Learn

This project is structured as a learning journey with four phases:

| Phase | You'll Do | You'll Understand | Time |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|------|
| **1. Local Dev** | Run `npm run docker:dev` | How containers provide consistent dev environments | 10 min |
| **2. Customize** | Use AI prompts to edit content | How to collaborate with AI coding assistants | 30 min |
| **3. Preview Prod** | Run `npm run docker:prod` | Difference between dev and production builds | 10 min |
| **4. Deploy** | Push to AWS App Runner | How cloud services host your applications | 20 min |

**Total time to deployed site: ~1-2 hours**

### Learning Checkpoints

After each phase, you should be able to answer:

- **Phase 1**: "What is a container and why does it help development?"
- **Phase 2**: "How do I give AI assistants effective instructions?"
- **Phase 3**: "Why are production builds different from development?"
- **Phase 4**: "What happens when I deploy to the cloud?"

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- [ ] Docker Desktop installed ([download](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/))
- [ ] An AI coding assistant (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, or Codex)
- [ ] Basic comfort with terminal/command line
- [ ] A text editor (VS Code recommended)

### Phase 1: Local Development

**Goal**: Get the site running on your machine

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pingwu/agentic-landing-template.git
cd agentic-landing-template

# Start the development container
npm run docker:dev

# Open http://localhost:3000
```

**What just happened?** Docker created an isolated environment with Node.js and all dependencies. Your code runs the same way on any machine — this is why companies use containers.

✅ **Checkpoint**: Can you see the landing page at localhost:3000?

### Phase 2: Customize with AI

**Goal**: Personalize the content using natural language

Open your AI assistant (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, or Codex) and try these prompts:

```
"Update the hero section with my name 'Your Name' and title 'Your Title'"
```

```
"Change the services section to list my three main offerings"
```

```
"Update the contact section with my email and LinkedIn"
```

**What just happened?** The AI read your code, understood the structure, and made targeted edits. You collaborated with AI to write code without writing code yourself.

✅ **Checkpoint**: Does the site reflect your personal brand?

### Phase 3: Production Preview

**Goal**: Test what will actually deploy to the cloud

```bash
# Stop development container
npm run docker:down

# Build and run production version
npm run docker:prod

# Open http://localhost:3001
```

**What just happened?** Docker built an optimized, smaller version of your site — the same thing that will run in the cloud. Production builds remove development tools and optimize for speed.

✅ **Checkpoint**: Does the production build look correct?

### Phase 4: Deploy to Cloud

**Goal**: Make your site live on the internet

See `docs/DEPLOYMENT-ROADMAP.md` for detailed AWS deployment steps.

Quick summary:
1. Push Docker image to AWS ECR (container registry)
2. Create App Runner service (managed hosting)
3. Get your public URL

**What just happened?** AWS is now running your container 24/7. When someone visits your URL, App Runner serves your site from the cloud.

✅ **Checkpoint**: Can you share your live URL with someone?

## Key Files

| File | Purpose | When to Edit |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `app/page.tsx` | Main landing page content | Customizing your content |
| `app/layout.tsx` | Site metadata, fonts | Changing title, description |
| `app/globals.css` | Global styles | Advanced styling |
| `components/` | Reusable UI components | Adding new features |
| `.skills/` | Agent skills (prompting patterns) | Learning advanced techniques |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Container configuration | Rarely |
| `Dockerfile` | Production build config | Rarely |

---

## Agent Skills

The `.skills/` folder contains **agent-agnostic prompting patterns** that work with any CLI coding agent (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI). These skills teach you how to orchestrate AI effectively.

### Available Skills

| Skill | When to Use | Key Concept |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **aws-cli-architect** | Provisioning cloud infrastructure | "Infrastructure is code. CLI commands are atoms." |
| **pm-design-thinking** | Defining features, prioritizing work | "Users don't want features. They want outcomes." |
| **multi-file-architecture** | Changes spanning multiple files | "Describe outcomes, not steps." |
| **test-driven-scaffolding** | Building new features, refactoring | "Tests are specifications in executable form." |
| **context-aware-debugging** | Fixing bugs, troubleshooting | "Errors are symptoms. Context reveals causes." |

### How to Use Skills

**Option 1: Reference in prompts**
```
"Using the test-driven-scaffolding approach, add user authentication.
Write the tests first, show me for approval, then implement."
```

**Option 2: Read skill file first**
```
"Read .skills/aws-cli-architect/SKILL.md, then help me provision
a production-ready ECS Fargate service following those patterns."
```

**Option 3: Ask agent to apply skill**
```
"Apply pm-design-thinking principles to this feature request:
'Add a dashboard'. What should I actually build?"
```

### Skill Deep Dives

#### aws-cli-architect
Orchestrate AWS infrastructure through CLI with cloud architect expertise—cost-aware, security-first, and production-ready patterns.

**Power Move**:
> "Before provisioning, show me: estimated monthly cost, security group rules, IAM permissions required, and what breaks if any single AZ goes down."

#### pm-design-thinking
Frame development through user outcomes and design thinking. Translate stakeholder needs into buildable specifications.

**Power Move**:
> "Before building, generate 3 different approaches to solving [user problem]. For each: the assumption it tests, simplest implementation, and how we'd know it worked."

#### multi-file-architecture
Coordinate changes across frontend, backend, database, and config in single operations.

**Power Move**:
> "Add user management: database table, API endpoints for CRUD, and dashboard component with edit/delete—all coherent, all at once."

#### test-driven-scaffolding
Invert the workflow: tests first, then implementation to pass them.

**Power Move**:
> "Write the tests, show me for approval, THEN implement. I want to validate the spec before you write production code."

#### context-aware-debugging
Accelerate debugging by providing diagnostic context that enables agent reasoning.

**Power Move**:
> "Explain three different hypotheses for why this could fail, then tell me what evidence would confirm or eliminate each."

### Creating Your Own Skills

Skills follow a simple structure:
```
.skills/
└── your-skill-name/
    └── SKILL.md
```

SKILL.md format:
```markdown
---
name: your-skill-name
description: When to use this skill and what it does
---

# Skill Title

## Core Principle
One sentence capturing the essence.

## Patterns
Examples of how to apply the skill.

## Power Move
The advanced technique that unlocks the skill's full potential.
```

## Container Commands Reference

All container commands use **detached mode** (run in background):

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `npm run docker:dev` | Start development with hot-reload |
| `npm run docker:prod` | Test production build locally |
| `npm run docker:down` | Stop all containers |
| `npm run docker:status` | Check container status |
| `npm run docker:logs` | View container logs |
| `npm run docker:shell` | Open terminal in container |
| `npm run docker:clean` | Remove containers and volumes |

---

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript
- Use explicit types (avoid `any`)
- The AI assistant will help with type errors

### React/Next.js
- Server Components by default (no `'use client'`)
- Add `'use client'` only when needed (hooks, interactivity)
- Preserve accessibility attributes

### Tailwind CSS 4
- Use utility classes in JSX
- Maintain dark mode compatibility (`dark:` variants)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Docker won't start
- Ensure Docker Desktop is running
- Try: `npm run docker:clean` then `npm run docker:dev`

### Build fails
- Check terminal for specific error message
- Ask your AI assistant: "The build is failing with this error: [paste error]"

### Site looks broken
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure you saved all files
- Try: `npm run docker:down && npm run docker:dev`

### AI changes broke something
- Use git to revert: `git checkout app/page.tsx`
- Start fresh: `git stash` to save changes, undo, try again

## Where to Go Next

This template is your starting point. The skills you've learned transfer to any project.

### What Past Users Have Built

> **Mark** started with this template, learned the fundamentals, and was inspired to build a **stock trading signal application** with backtesting. He deployed it to Vercel and is now exploring how to scale and market it.

Your next project could be:
- A client proposal or demo site
- An internal tool for your business
- A prototype to validate a new idea
- A dashboard or data visualization
- An AI-powered application

### Go Deeper with MACA

This template evolved from [**MACA (Multi-AI-Coding-Agent)**](https://github.com/pingwu/maca) — a comprehensive curriculum for AI-assisted development.

> *"The new professional superpower is not coding; it's orchestrating AI agents to build for you."*

MACA covers:
- 5 AI coding agents (Claude, Gemini, Cursor, Copilot, DeepAgent)
- 5 portfolio projects across different domains
- Advanced agent orchestration patterns

### Expanding Your Skills

| If You Want To... | Explore... |
|-------------------|------------|
| Add a database | Supabase, PlanetScale, or AWS RDS |
| Add authentication | NextAuth.js, Clerk, or Auth0 |
| Build an API | Next.js API routes or AWS Lambda |
| Add AI features | OpenAI API, Anthropic API, or AWS Bedrock |
| Deploy elsewhere | Vercel, Netlify, or AWS Amplify |

### The Question Remains

> **"When AI can do anything for you, what will you build?"**

You now have the foundation. The tools. The experience. What matters most to you?

---

## Constraints (What Not To Do)

### Do Not
- Run blocking container commands (always use `-d` flag or npm scripts)
- Remove accessibility attributes from HTML
- Delete TypeScript types without replacement
- Use deprecated Tailwind v3 patterns

### Always
- Use detached mode for container startup
- Keep TypeScript valid (ask AI to fix errors)
- Preserve mobile responsiveness
- Test changes before committing
